%PROBLEM 1
\item 
	Download and import data\\

	Note: all data manipulations are in python. Source code available if requested.\\

\item  %PROBLEM 2a

	%%2(a)   
    \item Plot of Calzetti attenuation\\
    
   		\begin{figure}[H]
		    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hw2_prob2a.png}
		    \caption{}
		    \label{}
   		\end{figure}
    
	    Here, I read in the "calzetti01.txt" file, and insert two data points to fill out the wavelength range (a point at $\lambda$ = 90$\AA$ with $A_V(\lambda)$ = 90.5 from a linear extrapolation on the blue end, and a point at $\lambda$ = 28500 $\AA$ with $A_V(\lambda)$ = 0 from Battisti, Calzetti, Chary [2017]). I then interpolated onto a 1$\AA$ grid, and, using the definitions below, I compute and plot ($f_{obs}/f_{int}$) for the two E(B-V) values:
    	\\
    	
    	\hspace{10mm} $A_{\lambda} = m_{obs} - m_{int} = -2.5log_{10}(\frac{\displaystyle f_{obs}}{\displaystyle f_{int}})$ \hspace{5mm} or \hspace{5mm} $f_{obs}/f_{int} = 10^{(-0.4 \cdot A_{\lambda} \cdot E(B-V))}$ \\
    	
		\hspace{10mm}	$A_{\lambda} = E(B-V) \cdot R_{\lambda}$ \hspace{5mm} or \hspace{5mm} $R_V = \frac{\displaystyle A_V}{\displaystyle E(B-V)}$\\	
    	
    	% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %
    	% %todo: I think R_V is essentially constant as a function of grain geometry and column density ... if E(B-V) changes, so should A_V (and in the same direction). So, it seems that R_V should be relatively constant, regardless of E(B-V)... that is, the slope of the extinction curve should be constant, though the whole curve can move up/down as E(B-V) (or A_B and A_V) change.
		% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

		Using the Calzetti data with V-Band $\approx$ 5000 - 7000 $\AA$, I average over the those wavelengths, I get $R_V$ $\approx$ 3.7 for both $E(B-V)$ values (given how the data is defined; we are really presented with only $A_{V}(\lambda)$ as $R_{V}(\lambda) \cdot E(B-V)$ for a particular normalization of $E(B-V)=1.0$ and do not know how $A_V$ varies with $E(B-V)$ (that is, we are not given anything that maps to $A_B$) so I cannot recompute explicitly). However, over a fixed wavelength range, for any given attenuation curve, I expect $R_V$ to be essentially constant with changes in $E(B-V)$ as changes to $A_V$ should scale with changes to $A_B$. The $R_V$ $\approx$ 3.7 value is in the expected range (2-5) and is fairly close to the canonical Milky Way value of 3.1, so that seems reasonable.

	%%2(b)       
    \item Attenuation Applied to Aged Spectra\\
    
       		\begin{figure}[H]
    		    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hw2_prob2b.png}
    		    \caption{}
    		    \label{}
       		\end{figure}
	       		
	       		
	 Here, I apply the attenuation factors from (2a) to the (total) integrated spectra from HW\#1 resulting in 9 curves: 3 ages $\times$ 3 attenuations, (0 yr, 500 Myr, 1 Gyr) $\times$ (none, $E(B-V)=0.1$, $E(B-V)=1.0$). To multiply with the attenuation data, the integrated spectra were truncated and aligned on the same wavelength grid.
    
    \newpage
    %%2(c)   
    \item g - r color for each spectra\\
    

    	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    	Age & E(B-V) & g$-$r color \\
    	  \hline
    	  0 Myr &  0.0 & -0.46 \\
    		   &  0.1 & -0.36 \\
    		   &  1.0 & 0.75 \\
    	  \hline
    	  500 Myr & 0.0 & -0.14 \\
    			  & 0.1 & -0.02 \\
    			  & 1.0 & 1.07 \\
    	  \hline
    	  1000 Myr &  0.0 & 0.18 \\
    	  		&  0.1 & 0.31 \\
    	  	    &  1.0 & 1.37 \\
    	  \hline
    	\end{tabular}
    
    Here, I convert the $\nu L_{\nu}$ form (same as $\lambda L_{\lambda}$) of the spectra from HW\#1 into a form proportional to $f_{\nu}$ as  $f_{\nu} \propto \lambda L_{lambda} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{c}$ (notice the single $\lambda$ in the fraction since there is already a $\lambda$ term in $\lambda L_{\lambda}$). I then calculate the flux under each of the request filters as:\\

	 	\hspace{10mm} $<F_{filter,\nu}> = \frac{\displaystyle \mathlarger{\int} \frac{1}{\nu} \cdot F(\nu) \cdot T(\nu)\ d\nu}{\displaystyle \mathlarger{\int} \frac{1}{\nu} \cdot T(\nu)\ d\nu}$ \\ 
	 	
	 using discrete array arithmetic in place of integrals, and being careful to keep the direction of the arrays correct (e.g. when converting between increasing wavelength and increasing frequency). Finally, the color (magnitude) is calculated from the ratio of the fluxes as: \\
	 
	\hspace{10mm} $ m_{g-r} = -2.5 log_{10}(\dfrac{f_g}{f_r})$\\
	
	Both aging and dust attenuation push the color toward the red (in aging, through the loss of the more massive, blue stars and in dust attenuation through the preferential reduction of bluer frequencies). There does not seem to be a good way to disentangle aging affects from dust attenuation, at least not with only the color from these two filters. With additional filters, we could probe the longer wavelength spectra where we start to see bigger differences between the two effects. An older population with little dust would not show the same bump in the infra-red as a younger, heavily obscured population. Basically, for an older population, the bluer energy is simply gone (no hot stars to produce it), but in a younger, dust obscured population the bluer energy is re-radiated (by the heated dust) in the infra-red.

    \item SED Fitting\\
    
  		\begin{figure}[H]

		    \caption{}
		    \label{}
   		\end{figure}
   		
   		
   	The best fit (lowest $\chi^2$) is the 1 Gyr with zero attenuation ($\chi^2=0.15$) followed closely by the 1 Gyr with $E(B-V) = 0.1$ ($\chi^2=0.77$) and 500 Myr with $E(B-V)=0.1$ ($\chi^2=0.93$). The other possible solutions have much higher $\chi^2$ values.\\
   	
   	Here, I kept the 9 spectra from earlier in frequency space and in $f_{\nu}$ units and computed the flux under each of the 5 (grizy) filters from HW\#1 using the same procedure as before.
   	
  		\hspace{10mm} $<F_{filter,\nu}> = \frac{\displaystyle \mathlarger{\int} \frac{1}{\nu} \cdot F(\nu) \cdot T(\nu)\ d\nu}{\displaystyle \mathlarger{\int} \frac{1}{\nu} \cdot T(\nu)\ d\nu}$ \\
   			 	
   	I then perform $\chi^2$ fits of each of those 9 spectra against the 5 matching filters in the galaxy\_photo.txt dataset, incorporating the uncertainties. The $\chi^2$ is allowed to scale to find the optimal constant and scale factor (as below), then the 9 fits are compared using their own best scaling and with the lowest $\chi^2$ corresponding to the "best" fit.\\
   	
   		\hspace{10mm} $\chi ^2 = \sum \frac{\displaystyle (data_i - c \cdot model_i)^2}{\displaystyle data\ error_i^2}$
   		\\
   		
   		\hspace{10mm} where c is a scaling factor determined by: \\
   		
   		\hspace{10mm} $c = \frac{\displaystyle \sum (data_i \cdot model_i)/(data\ error_i)^2}{\displaystyle \sum (model_i)^2/(data\ error_i)^2}$\\

  \begin{enumerate} % 3a
  \item Estimate inclination of NGC5055 from FITS image.\\ 
  
  My estimation of the inclination is $49^{\circ} \pm 1^{\circ}$ (nominal best case error ... depends on a hand-wavy estimate of my ability to locate the end points of the major and minor axes) \\
  
  
  The procedure I used was to zscale the image and add contour lines and find the major and minor axes' lengths by the simple Cartesian distance formula connecting pairs of points on opposite ends of the galaxy's disk such that the lines pass through the disk center at right angles. The contours were used to find similar flux counts on opposite ends of the disk. The basic assumptions were that the disk is essentially circular (so if the inclination were face on, the two axis would be of equal length) and that the brightness is a uniform function of the radius. I use the nearest whole pixel value and perform the calculation in pixel space, so there is an inherent error of $\pm 1$ pixel on each of the 8 coordinates measured (2 coordinates for each of the 4 points) plus an unknown uncertainty in judgment as to where to place the line segment endpoints. I assume an error in placement of $\pm 5$ pixels (rolling the pixel rounding error in to that number).\\
  
  The inclination then, is $cos^{-1}(minor\ axis/major\ axis)$ (note: $cos^{-1}$ since I want equal lengths (or $\cos^{-1}(1)$) to give an inclination of $0^{\circ}$ )\\
  
  Selected points (pixel space): (363,560), (541,344), (231,369), (621,539)
  
  Minor axis length = 279.9 $\pm 5\sqrt{2}$
  
  Major axis length = 425.4 $\pm 5\sqrt{2}$\\
  
  Error propagation via:  $\lvert \delta Q \rvert\ =\ \lvert \frac{\displaystyle dq}{\displaystyle dx} \rvert \delta x$ \\

  \item Surface Brightness %3b
  
    		\begin{figure}[H]
  		    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hw2_prob3b.png}
  		    \caption{}
  		    \label{}
     		\end{figure}
     		
   Here I use the measurement from (3a) to create a surface brightness profile model in 2D (technically using a Sersic model for future flexibility, but with the Sersic index set to 1.0).\\
   
   \hspace{10mm} $\Sigma (r)\ =\ \Sigma _{cent}$ exp(-r/h)
   
   -or-
   
   \hspace{10mm} $\Sigma (r)\ =\ \Sigma _{cent}$ exp[($\frac{\displaystyle  r}{\displaystyle  r_e})^{(1/n)}$] where n = 1
   
   -or- (more common form)
   
   \hspace{10mm} $\Sigma (r)\ =\ \Sigma _{cent}$ exp\{$-b_n [(\frac{\displaystyle  r}{\displaystyle r_{1/2}})^{(1/n)}-1]$\} where n = 1 and $b_n$ = 2n-$\frac{1}{3}$
   
   \hspace{10mm} (note: h = $r_e$ = $\frac{r_{1/2}}{ln(2)}$)\\
   
  
   The model image is inclined per the value in (3a) and rotated counter-clockwise by the position angle ($10^{\circ}$ since the reference axis is itself rotated by $90^{\circ}$ counter-clockwise).\\
   
   The value of $\Sigma _{cent}$ is set such that a realization of the model scales to match the center (brightest pixel) of the galaxy.\\
   
   The value of h is set initially as a guess and is then optimized (to 2 decimal places) by minimizing a 2D $\chi^2$ as a loss function (see problem 2D, but with a second dimension added to the function) on a grid against the original image cropped to roughly contain only the galaxy (numpy array sliced to [288:594,168:640]). \\
   
   The optimal h is found to be 259.63 pixels as a half-light radius (or 374.57 pixels as 1/e radius, noting that $R_{1/2}\ = R_e \cdot ln(2)$)\\
   
   \newpage
   \item Surface Brightness Residuals\\ %3c
   
   Note that most of (3c) was actually executed as part of (3b)
   
       		\begin{figure}[H]
     		    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hw2_prob3c1.png}
     		    \caption{}
     		    \label{}
        		\end{figure}
  

         		\begin{figure}[H]
         		\centering
       		    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{hw2_prob3c2.png}
       		    \caption{}
       		    \label{}
          		\end{figure}

  Here, the optimal realization of the model from 3b is subtracted from the (cropped) galaxy image and plotted next to it. Additionally, a histogram of the residuals is made. (Note: as a sanity check, additional inclinations were tried at $60^{\circ}$ and $40^{\circ}$) and both produced substantial bias from 0 in the residuals).\\
  
  You can see that the model is far from perfect, however, the residuals do peak at zero and fall off fairly sharply. \\
  
  Galaxy features are still clearly visible in the residual map (such as dust lanes in the spiral arms that are over subtracted, small bright regions (over densities of stars and/or more rapid star formation that are under subtracted, etc)) and that makes sense as the profile created only smoothly varying as a function of radius and does not deal with variations in brightness due to local conditions.\\
  
  Using simple geometry (small angle approximation), a distance of 9.4 Mpc and a pixel scale of 1:1 (arcsec:pix), I estimate the physical scale length as:\\
  
  \hspace{10mm} h[kpc] = $9400 [kpc] \cdot \frac{h["]}{3600} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}$ \\
  
  This yields h (as $R_{1/2}$) = 11.9 kpc (or as $R_{e}$ = 17.1 kpc).\\
  
  These numbers are not completely unreasonable but do see high by maybe a factor of a few. I think a better approach would be an MCMC fit with inclination, scale length (h or $r_e$), scale factor (the multiplier to scale up the brightness from 1), and Sersic index as parameters to fit. In my method, the brightness scale factor is calculated from the scale length (so it is not a free fit) and the inclination and Sersic index are fixed. Although the residual is essentially unbiased (in that its mean is zero), it over fits the bulge brightness (and the bulge, by itself, would have a larger Sersic index) and under fits the disk (Sersic index closer to 1).\\
  
  \item Surface Brightness Units Conversion \\%3d
    
  \hspace{10mm} $\Sigma \ = 10^{0.4(26.4- \mu)} L_{\odot} pc^{-2}$ \\

  First, to covert between magnitudes and luminosity, we use the distance modulus to convert between arcsecs and parsecs (in magnitude space) such that:\\
  
  \hspace{10mm} $5 log_{10}(180^{\circ}/\pi \cdot 3600"/{}^{\circ} \cdot 1/10pc) \approx 21.572 \approx 21.6$ \\
  
  Now we can convert between magnitudes and solar Luminosities as:\\

  \hspace{10mm} $\mu = M_{\odot} + 21.6 - 2.5 log_{10}(\Sigma)$ 
  
  \hspace{10mm} where:
  
  \hspace{20mm} $M_{\odot}$ is the absolute bolometric AB magnitude of the Sun = 4.8
  
  \hspace{20mm} $\mu$ is in units of $magnitudes/arcsec^2$
  
  \hspace{20mm} $\Sigma$ is in units of $L_{\odot}/pc^2$ \\
  
  This becomes then:\\
  
  \hspace{10mm} $\mu = 26.4 - 2.5 log_{10}(\Sigma)$ \\
  
  And, solving for $\Sigma$:\\
  
  \hspace{10mm} $\Sigma \ = 10^{0.4(26.4- \mu)}$ \\
  
  \newpage
  
   \item Analytic Surface Brightness and Luminosity \\%3e
   
   
   The estimate for  $L_{tot} \approx 4.5\times10^{10} L_{\odot}$.\\
   
     First, I convert the $mag/arcsec^2$ to $L_{\odot}/pc^2$ units using the relationship from (3d) and radial distance from arcminutes to pc using the small angle approximation ($\theta = d/D$).\\
     
	Next, I use those four data points in the surface brightness equation from (3b) and from the resulting system of four equations, solve for $\Sigma_{cent} \approx 660$ and $h \approx 3500pc$. These are estimates from variable substitution. I then use these as initial values to "best" fit a curve to the four points (note that without uncertainties in the data and with only four points, I have restricted the results to a single significant digit). The "best" fit parameters found are:\\
	
	\hspace{10mm} $\Sigma_{cent} \approx 800 L_{\odot}/pc^{2}$ \hspace{5mm}  $h \approx 3000 pc$\\
	
	Lastly, I integrate over all radii (out to some limit, but with the declining surface brightness, we easily converge in less than 10h) as:
	
	\hspace{10mm} $L_{tot} = 2\pi \Sigma_{cent} \mathlarger{\int_{0}^{10h}} e^{-r/h}\ r dr \approx 4.5\times10^{10} L_{\odot} $ 
	

	where the area element (dA) becomes that of an annulus ($2\pi rdr$) under the assumption that the galaxy is a pure disk and radially symmetric.\\  
	
	The final results (top) are high by a factor of a few due to the limited data, lack of uncertainties, and the fit to a pure disk (Sersic index of 1), which will result in radial surface luminosity curve that is more shallow than that of a higher index (in other words, it will not have the rapid fall-off from the bulge).
	     
  
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  
  \item Most Surprising ...\\
  
  For me, I don't know that there is a singular piece of information or technique that I find "most surprising", but there are two trends that I find surprising and distressing. First, it is surprising how much uncertainty is hidden in the narrative of galaxy formation that is generally presented as being well known (we know how gas forms stars, we know the mass of galaxies, we know how galaxies grow, etc). Second, it is somewhat distressing (though understandable since you have to assume something for lack of anything else) how single element or small datasets are globalized or used as the model for objects under very different conditions (i.e Milky Way dust model (or SMC dust model) or the "universal" IMF applied to high-z observations). The danger of drawing poor conclusions is compounded further at each additional step as more (potentially incorrect) assumptions are stacked on the previous ones.\\
  
  
  \item Important Issues ...
	  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item How galaxies collect the gas that fuels their growth/star formation? We now (think) we know where (all?) the baryons live and can see there is a large gas reservoir for galaxies to tap, but does most of the gas come in from cold flows or from the stripping of gas from minor mergers? And how do we cool that gas to the point where we can form stars on the time lines we expect? Since we mostly observe star light, understanding the star formation rates/history of galaxies from the onset of gas accretion would be, perhaps, the single best tool (or framework) for understanding the life-cycle of galaxies.\\
	  
	  \item What is the explanation of the relationship between SMBH and host galaxy (or at least bulge for spirals)? There is an obvious correlation between the mass of the central SMBH and the mass of the galaxy (or more tightly to the bulge mass in spirals) and it is clear that the two know about each other and co-evolve, but the sphere of influence of the SMBH is much smaller than even the scale length of the bulge. Understanding how/if the galaxy feeds the SMBH and how the SMBH might regulate star formation and gas accretion would go a long way to explaining the formation and evolution of both.\\
	  
	  \item When did reionization (significantly) begin and how did it proceed? This is effectively a question about what is the primary driver ... QSOs and AGN? high and sustained star formation in massive or dwarf galaxies? In all of the leading contenders, the source of the ionizing radiation is galaxies ... but which ones and what was the mechanism? Answering this question would answer much about how (and when) galaxies grow (and the stars they produce, the IMF, etc), how much dust they produce and how it is distributed, and how galaxies shape their environment (and how the environment influences the galaxies).
